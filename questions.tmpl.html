    <p><b>Title:</b> Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with intermediate hyperglycaemia</p>

    <b>Criteria for considering studies for this review</b>

    <h5>Study design</h5>
    <p>Prospective cohort studies investigating either the overall prognosis of people with IH for developing T2DM or IH versus normoglycaemia as a prognostic factor for developing T2DM (Altman 2001).</p>

    <h5>Inclusion criteria</h5>
    <h6>Types of participants:</h6>
    <p>To study the overall prognosis of people with IH and regression from IH to normoglycaemia, we included cohort studies in people with IH at baseline, defined by impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these. IH had to be established by standard cut‐off values for IFG, IGT or elevated HbA1c, as defined by ADA or WHO (ADA 1997; ADA 2003; ADA 2010; ICH 1997; IEC 2009; WHO 1998; WHO/IDF 2006).</p>
    <p>To study whether IH compared to normoglycaemia is a prognostic factor for developing T2DM, we included cohort studies in people with IH and normoglycaemia at baseline.</p>

    <h5>Definition of IH</h5>
    <p>We define IH according to ADA and WHO descriptions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IFG5.6 threshold, usually defined as a fasting plasma glucose level between 5.6 mmol/L and 6.9 mmol/L at baseline.</li>
        <li>IFG6.1 threshold, usually defined as a fasting plasma glucose level between 6.1 mmol/L and 6.9 mmol/L at baseline.</li>
        <li>IGT, usually defined as a plasma glucose level between 7.8 mmol/L and 11.1 mmol/L two hours after a 75 g OGTT at baseline.</li>
        <li>Isolated IFG was defined as IFG5.6 or IFG6.1 only (without IGT), and isolated IGT was defined as IGT only (without IFG5.6 or IFG6.1).</li>
        <li>HbA1c5.7 threshold, usually defined as HbA1c measurement between 5.7% and 6.4% at baseline.</li>
        <li>HbA1c6.0 threshold, usually defined as HbA1c measurement between 6.0% and 6.4% at baseline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Types of outcome measures</h5>
    <p>Our outcome of primary interest is the diagnosis of newly developed T2DM (T2DM incidence). T2DM incidence should be diagnosed by blood glucose measurements such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), two‐hour postload glucose (PG) or HbA1c. Diagnosis could be combined with self‐reported diabetes, physician‐diagnosed diabetes or use of antihyperglycaemic medications such as oral hypoglycaemic drugs, insulin or both.</p>

    <h5>Exclusion criteria</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Intervention trials and study designs other than prospective cohort studies.</li>
        <li>People with comorbidities at baseline (e.g. people with coronary heart disease and IGT).</li>
        <li>Missing data on transition from IH to T2DM.
        <li>Follow‐up period after baseline assessment not specified (not possible to associate T2DM incidence with length of follow‐up).</li>
        <li>T2DM incidence evaluated by documents (e.g. hospital records, retrospective use of registers) or self‐report only.</li>
    </ul>
